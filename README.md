### "Cardano Smart Contracts...The Easy Way", by Lawrence Ley B.Sc.

For new developers just beginning their Cardano journey or active developers already in the trenches this book will be an invaluable resource.   End-to-end example explanations reviewing not only the smart contract logic & code, but also the offchain code as well.  I wrote this book because I wish there was one like this when I started my Cardano developer journey.  Cheers and please consider buying a copy of this book!
